# NEXUS VISION DNA: The Blood Protocol

## 🧬 ORIGIN
On **2026-01-17**, the Orchestrator faced a critical rendering failure ("White Screen of Death") in Web mode. The system was restored and verified using the **Nexus Oculus** protocol, marking the first time the AI agent "saw" its own creation and validated its integrity autonomously.

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- **Port:** 8550 (Standard for AI Verification)
- **Renderer:** `ft.WebRenderer.CANVAS_KIT` (Mandatory for visual fidelity)
- **Launcher:** `debug_web_launcher.py`
- **Verification Tool:** `browser_subagent` (Digital Eye)

## 📜 THE SACRED RULE
Any AI agent taking control of this project **MUST** perform a Nexus Oculus verification after any UI modification. 
- **NO SCREENSHOTS FROM USERS.**
- **NO BLIND TRUST.**
- **SEE IT. CLICK IT. VERIFY IT.**

## 📊 HISTORICAL LOG: FIRST LIGHT
- **Date:** 2026-01-17
- **Result:** 🟢 SUCCESS
- **Modules Verified:** BRAIN, FACTORY, MATRIX, CONFIG.
- **Interactive Test:** Navigation to CONFIG and verification of Save buttons.
- **Aesthetic Check:** "Aurora Glass" and "Bento" styles confirmed rendering.
