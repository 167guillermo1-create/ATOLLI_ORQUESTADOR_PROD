# Project Change Log

## [2026-01-16] Interface Backup
- **Action**: Backup of `main.py` created as `main_backup_v1.py`.
- **Reason**: User requested a checkpoint before implementing visual thumbnails and responsive UI updates in the Factory module.
- **State**: `main.py` operational with basic text buttons and fixed header/footer.

## [2026-01-16] Factory Visual Upgrade
- **Action**: Implemented `ThumbnailCard` and responsive grid in Factory module.
- **Fix**: Resolved `AttributeError` for icons by using string literals (`"water_drop"`).
- **Fix**: Resolved `AttributeError` for animation by using integer shorthand (`animate=300`).
- **State**: Factory module now features a responsive, visual selection interface. Application stable.

## [2026-01-17] Nexus Oculus: First Light (Full AI Verification)
- **Action**: Restoration and full automated verification of the Orchestrator via "Digital Eye".
- **Fix**: Replaced `ft.IconButton` with `ft.ElevatedButton` for Web stability.
- **Protocol**: Nexus Oculus (Port 8550) established as the **Gold Standard** for UI integrity.
- **Proof**: Successful automated navigation through BRAIN -> CONFIG modules verified by `browser_subagent`.
- **UI Upgrade**: Interface converted to full Responsive/Adaptive design (Maximized Window support).
- **State**: Project fully operational and AI-verifiable.

## [2026-01-17] Strategic Pivot: Twin-Stack Architecture

## [2026-01-19] Digital Eye Verification Restored
- **Action**: implemented `verify_full_flow.py` for automated Desktop verification using Nexus Oculus protocol.
- **Verification**: Validated navigation through BRAIN, FACTORY, MATRIX, and CONFIG modules.
- **Web Interface**: Confirmed web server operation on port 8570 (via `verify_web_full.py`) allowing external verification.
- **Roadmap Alignment**: Completed pre-requisite stability checks (Chapter 0/1) to ensure UI is ready for Chapter 2 (Cloud Integration).
- **Persistence**: Verified `nexus_state` and `usage_logs` sync with Supabase via `verify_nexus_persistence.py`. Token tracking is active and persistent across sessions.
- **Intelligence Layer**: Activated `healer_loop.py` integrating `QAArbiter` (Static Analysis) and `NexusHealer` (Mechanical Repair) for autonomous defect resolution (Chapter 2.1).
